                    <h3>Mission</h3>
                    <p>A Mission is about what the organization does to achieve the vision. A mission is an action
                        statement
                        to
                        achieve the vision. A mission statement is not required to be inspirational. Instead, it
                        provides a
                        clear focus on what an organization does and what it doesn’t.</p>

                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>A vision is a Big Picture of “What” the organization wants to achieve in Future. It should
                        inspire
                        people
                        in the organization. It excites people to be part of “What.” And, also motivate to put their
                        energy
                        and
                        time to achieve the future.</p>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p> goal is a broad definition, saying “improve profitability”. It lacks the specifics and defined
                        in
                        general and broad terms. Objectives, on the other hand, are quite specific and further define
                        the
                        goal.
                        To continue with ‘profitability’ example, objectives can be defined </p>
